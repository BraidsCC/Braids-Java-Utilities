# Braids-Java-Utilities

Herein lie miscellaneous Java utilities, including some handy bits for porting Python code to Java.  (Sorry, Guido.)

To build everything, run gradle or, if you don't want to install Gradle, run gradlew.  The resulting jar file goes into the repos/ directory, and the javadocs go into build/docs/javadoc/.
