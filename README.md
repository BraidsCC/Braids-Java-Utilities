# Braids-Java-Utilities

Herein lie miscellaneous Java utilities, including some handy bits for porting Python code to Java.  (Sorry, Guido.)

## Developer instructions

To make a jar file from the project in Eclipse ((Java Neon)?), first do a full build in Eclipse.  Make sure there is a bin/ directory next to the src/ directory with lots of class files (deep) within.  Then, right-click on Braids-Java-Utilities in the Package Explorer, choose Properties, click Builders, check ON "BJU-Jar", click OK, then click Project Menu, Build All.
